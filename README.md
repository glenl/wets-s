# wets-s

`wets-s` is a WETS service that interacts with a
[nats-server](https://nats.io/)
to allow WETS simulators written in any language that supports NATS.

This is a literate programming document that requires additional tooling
to create the code and documentation present in this project. It is written in
[Asciidoctor](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/) and requires the
[atangle](https://repos.modelrealization.com/cgi-bin/fossil/mrtools/wiki?name=Aweb+Downloads)
tool to un-tangle the source code.
